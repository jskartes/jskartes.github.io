    Joshua was born on September 13, 1982 in Muskegon, Michigan. The talent and nurture of Joshua's family sparked an intense interest in performing and creating music at a young age. Joshua made his "big stage" performance debut at the age of eleven as "Oliver Twist" in Muskegon Civic Theatre's April 1994 production of <em>Oliver!</em>, and there has been no turning back since.

    The myriad experiences in the world of music throughout Joshua's childhood led him to attend the renowned Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana. There, he studied with many inspiring musicians, including composers David Dzubay, Sven-David Sandström, P. Q. Phan and Don Freund, and pianist Jean-Louis Haguenauer. He received his bachelor's degree in music composition and piano performance in 2005. While in Bloomington, Joshua also developed a very strong professional relationship with his friend and colleague, renowned choral composer and hammer dulcimer player <a href="http://www.oooliticmusic.com/">Malcolm Dalglish</a>. The two continue to collaborate with Dalglish's summer camp series, <em>Camp Ooolation!</em>, where Joshua is a resident clinician and composer, and in the folk quartet <em>Ooodoo</em> (also featuring Naomi Dalglish and Los Angeles–based singer/composer Moira Smiley) which released its debut commercial recording in 2007 featuring the songs of Dalglish, entitled <em>Into the Sky</em>.
